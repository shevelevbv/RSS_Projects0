# Memory Game
This branch was used for creating a memory game: the user opens a card and another one: if they match, they remain opened, otherwise both flip.<br>
The game has 2 modes:
- Classic. The number of moves is unlimited, and the game ends when all the cards are opened.
- Challenge. The player has an opportunity to look at all the cards for some seconds before opening them. However, the number of moves is limited by the score. If the player guesses correctly, the score increases, otherwise it decreases. When the score is 0, the player loses.

The game features the top player table, which shows the players' names (which the users input after winning the game) and their results. The records are stored in the local storage, and they are restored when the user decides to play again.

The project was nominated for one of the best works.<br> 
Peers' feedback (60 is the maximum score for the project):
