# Portfolio - Part 2: Responsive Design
This branch was used for further work on the photographer's portfolio webpage.<br>
Responsive design support was added, with desktop-first being the basic principle. The content is guaranteed to display correctly on screens 320px up to 1440px wide.<br>
768px is the key breakpoint. The navigation menu hides, and a burger icon appears instead. The animations of the burger icon and the side panel were added via JavaScript. Besides, the images' layout and sizes change as the screen width decreases.
