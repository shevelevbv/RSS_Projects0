# Portfolio - Part 3: Interactivity

This branch was used for completing the work on the photographer's portfolio webpage.<br>
The following features were added:
- Translation. The page can be displayed either in English or in Russian based on the user's preference. The translation was added using a separate JavaScript file and HTML data attributes. 
- Dark/light theme. A special icon in the menu allows the user to select a preferred theme. When the user clicks on the icon, the icon and the pages' design change. 
- Local storage. The browser saves the user's preferences (the language and theme) in the local storage before closing/reloading the page and restores them after opening.
- Different pictures depending on the user's choice of the season. 
- Custom videoplayer in the Video section. JavaScript was used for displaying the elapsed time and the total duration and enabling the user to play/pause the video, change the volume, and enter the fullscreen mode.


The work was among the best, according to the peers' and authorized assistants' choice.<br> 
Peers' feedback (75 is the maximum score for the project):
