- A Photographer's Portfolio

[visit project's page](https://shevelevbv.github.io/RSS_Projects0/portfolio/)

The project is a landing page presenting an entrepreneur protographer's information for their customers. The basic layout has been created with the use of HTML and CSS (with both Flexbox and Grid). JavaScript is used for animations (like the change of the theme icon and the burger menu icon) and for the video player in one of the portfolio's sections. The landing page features the resposive design: the content is fully displayed on screens 1440px - 320px (the Desktop-first principle). I've also added the local storage support to keep the user's settings (language and theme).   
- Image Gallery

The project is a webpage displaying pictures on some topic specified by the user. The project has been created with the help of Unsplash API.
- Memory Game

[visit project's page](https://shevelevbv.github.io/RSS_Projects0/memory-game/)

The project is a popular memory game: the user opens a card and another one: if they match, they remain opened, otherwise both flip. The logic of the game has been created using JavaScript.
